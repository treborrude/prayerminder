"Rejoice always, pray continually, give thanks in all circumstances; for this
is Godâ€™s will for you in Christ Jesus." - 1 Thessolonians 5:16-18

PrayerMinder
============

God gave me the idea for PrayerMinder when I ran across a similar app for iOS,
called PrayerMate. I thought it was a great idea to have a prayer journalling
app for smartphones, since I'm too mentally disorganized to keep the many
needs among family, friends, and the world readily recallable. However, I
wasn't able to find any similar app available for Android. Since I'm a software
developer, I decided to create my own.

That was back in March of 2012. At the time, I was the father of a four-month
old and preparing for an intercontinental move, and this was my first Android
app. Now I'm the father of a 16-month old, the move is over, but this is still
my first Android app. The development is likely to proceed at a snail's pace
(but, at least with move behind me, that's up from a glacial pace).

Goals
-----

* Encourage prayer by allowing users to organize the concerns that God has
  given them.
* Guide users through the prayer process by following the model of the Lord's
  prayer (or a similar model, like ACTS / CATS).
* Keep app permissions to a minimum by using a plugin architecture.
* Design the UI from the start to be scalable from handsets to tablets.
